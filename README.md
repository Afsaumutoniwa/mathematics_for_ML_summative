Dataset Description
1. Overview
The dataset contains agricultural and environmental factors influencing different crops in a hydroponic farming system. It is used to analyze soil conditions and predict the optimal pH levels for different crops.

2. Features in the Dataset
Each row represents a unique data point containing seven key attributes that impact crop growth:

pH: Acidity or alkalinity of the growing environment.

Soil EC (dS/m): Electrical conductivity, indicating the nutrient concentration.

Nitrogen (ppm): Essential for leaf growth and overall plant health.

Phosphorus (ppm): Supports root development and flowering.

Potassium (ppm): Regulates water uptake and strengthens plant resistance.

Moisture (%): Percentage of water present in the soil/growth medium.

Temperature (Â°C): Optimal temperature for each crop.

Crop: The crop type, encoded as follows:

Crop	Encoding
Bell Pepper	0
Bitter Gourd	1
Carrot	2
Corn	3
Cucumber	4
Eggplant	5
Green Chili	6
Lettuce	7
Mustard Greens	8
Pechay	9
Squash	10
Tomato	11
Watermelon	12
3. Data Source
The dataset was sourced from Zenodo, a research data repository, and can be accessed here:"https://zenodo.org/records/14276906/files/Book1%20(2).csv?download=1"
